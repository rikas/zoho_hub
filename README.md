# ZohoHub

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/zoho_hub.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/zoho_hub)

Simple wrapper around Zoho CRM version2, using
[OAuth 2.0 protocol](https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/developer/api/oauth-overview.html) for authentication.

This gem reads your Module configuration and builds the corresponding classes for you, using some
reflection mechanisms. You should then be able to use simple classes with an API close to
ActiveRecord, to do CRUD operations.

**NOTE: this gem is WIP, please try to use it and open an issue if you run into limitations / problems**

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'zoho_hub'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zoho_hub

## Setup process

### 1. Register your application

If you want to access your Zoho CRM account from your application you first need to create your
application as described here: https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/developer/api/register-client.html.

This will give you a **Client ID** and a **secret**, that you'll use in
[step 2](#2-configure-zohohub-with-your-credentials).

#### 1.1 Zoho Accounts URL

Registration and authorization requests are made to Zoho's domain-specific Accounts URL which
varies depending on your region:

- China: https://accounts.zoho.com.cn
- EU: https://accounts.zoho.eu
- India: https://accounts.zoho.in
- US: https://accounts.zoho.com

ZohoHub uses the EU Account URL by default, but this can be overriden in a `ZohoHub.configure` block
via the `api_domain` method ([step 2](#2-configure-zohohub-with-your-credentials).)

#### 1.2 Authorized Redirect URI

Per Zoho's API documentation, providing a **redirect URI** is optional. Doing so allows a user of
your application to be redirected back to your app (to the **redirect URI**) with a **grant token**
upon successful authentication.

If you don't provide a **redirect URI**, you'll need to use the
[self-client option](https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/developer/api/auth-request.html#self-client) for
authorization (see [3.2](#32-self-client-authorization).)

---

### 2. Configure ZohoHub with your credentials

> **Note:** Treat these credentials like an important password. It is _strongly_ recommended to not
> paste them anywhere in plain text. Do _not_ add them to version control; keep them out of your
> code directly by referencing them via environment variables. Use something like the dotenv gem or
> encrypted credentials in Rails to keep them as secret and secure as possible.

You need to have a configuration block like the one below (in Rails add a `zoho_hub.rb` in your
`config/initializers` directory):

```ruby
ZohoHub.configure do |config|
  config.client_id    = 'YOUR_ZOHO_CLIENT_ID' # obtained in 1.
  config.secret       = 'YOUR_ZOHO_SECRET'    # obtained in 1.
  config.redirect_uri = 'YOUR_ZOHO_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL'
  config.api_domain   = 'https://accounts.zoho.com' # can be omitted if in the EU
  # config.debug      = true # this will be VERY verbose, but helps to identify bugs / problems
end
```

---

### 3. Authorization request

In order to access data in Zoho CRM you need to authorize ZohoHub to access your account. To do so
you have to request a specific URL with the right **scope** and **access_type**. Successful
authorization will provide a **grant token** which will be used to generate **access** and
**refresh tokens**.

#### 3.1 Redirection based authentication

To get the right URL you can use this simple line of code:

```ruby
ZohoHub::Auth.auth_url
# => "https://accounts.zoho.eu/oauth/v2/auth?access_type=offline&client_id=&redirect_uri=&response_type=code&scope=ZohoCRM.modules.custom.all,ZohoCRM.settings.all,ZohoCRM.modules.contacts.all,ZohoCRM.modules.all"
```

If you request this generated URL you should see a screen like this one, where you have to click on
"Accept":

![](https://duaw26jehqd4r.cloudfront.net/items/1h1i3C1N0k0i02092F0S/Screen%20Shot%202018-11-25%20at%2019.18.38.png)

You will then be redirected to the **redirect URI** you provided with additional query parameters
as follows (the value after `code=` is the **grant token**):

```
{redirect_uri}?code={grant_token}&location=us&accounts-server=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.zoho.com
```

#### 3.2 Self-Client Authorization

If you don't have a **redirect URI** or you want your application to be able to authorize with Zoho
programmatically (without a user required to be present and click the "Accept" prompt), Zoho
provides a
[self-client option](https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/developer/api/auth-request.html#self-client)
for authentication which will provide a **grant token**.

#### 3.3 More on scopes

You can change the default scope (what data can be accessed by your application). This is the list
provided as the default scope:

```
ZohoCRM.modules.custom.all
ZohoCRM.settings.all
ZohoCRM.modules.contacts.all
ZohoCRM.modules.all
```

To get the URL for a different scope you can provide a `scope` argument:

```ruby
ZohoHub::Auth.auth_url(scopes: ['ZohoCRM.modules.custom.all', 'ZohoCRM.modules.all'])
# => "https://accounts.zoho.eu/oauth/v2/auth?access_type=offline&client_id=&redirect_uri=&response_type=code&scope=ZohoCRM.modules.custom.all,ZohoCRM.modules.all"
```

Refer to
[Zoho's API documentation on scopes](https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/developer/api/oauth-overview.html#scopes)
for detailed information.

#### 3.4 Offline access

By design the **access tokens** returned by the OAuth flow expire after a period of time (1 hour by
default), as a safety mechanism. This means that any application that wants to work with a user's
data needs the user to have recently gone through the OAuth flow, aka be online.

When you request offline access the Zoho API returns a **refresh token**. **Refresh tokens** give
your application the ability to request data on behalf of the user when the user is not present and
in front of your application.

**By default `ZohoHub::Auth.auth_url` will request offline access**

You can force "online" access by using `#auth_url` with a `access_type` argument:

```ruby
ZohoHub::Auth.auth_url(access_type: 'online')
# => "https://accounts.zoho.eu/oauth/v2/auth?access_type=online&client_id=&redirect_uri=&response_type=code&scope=ZohoCRM.modules.custom.all,ZohoCRM.settings.all,ZohoCRM.modules.contacts.all,ZohoCRM.modules.all"
```

---

### 4. Access token

See Zoho's API documentation for generating an initial **access token**:
https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/developer/api/access-refresh.html

To use an **access token** in a manual request, include it as a request header as
`Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken {access_token}` (without the braces.)

To use an **access token** with ZohoHub, pass it to the `ZohoHub.setup_connection` method as the
`access_token` parameter.

---

### 5. Refresh token

This gem automatically refresh the access token.

If you want automatic refresh, use the `refresh_token` argument as in the next chapter.

---

### 6. Basic ZohoHub flow

Once ZohoHub has been configured with your credentials (section 2) and you have a fresh **access
token**, setup a ZohoHub connection:

```ruby
ZohoHub.setup_connection access_token: 'ACCESS_TOKEN',
                         expires_in: 'EXPIRES_IN_SEC',
                         api_domain: 'API_DOMAIN',
                         refresh_token: 'REFRESH_TOKEN'
```

Now you can issue requests to Zoho's API with the Connection object, e.g.:

```ruby
# request a (paginated) list of all Lead records
ZohoHub.connection.get 'Leads'
```

A successful request will receive a response like the sample here:
https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/developer/api/get-records.html.

---

### 7. BaseRecord and record classes

At this point, ZohoHub is starting to do some of the heavy lifting, but using `ZohoHub.connection`
still gets tedious after just a handful of requests. But we can improve that by allowing ZohoHub
to build our record classes or by manually defining them ourselves.

#### 7.1 Reflection

TODO

#### 7.2 Subclassing BaseRecord

See `lib/zoho_hub/base_record.rb` and any of the classes in `examples/models/` for reference.

For any Zoho module with which you want to interact via ZohoHub, make a class of the same name that
inherits from `ZohoHub::BaseRecord`. For example, to build a class for the Leads module:

```ruby
# lead.rb

class Lead < ZohoHub::BaseRecord
  ...
end
```

Specify this module's fields as attributes:

```ruby
# lead.rb

class Lead < ZohoHub::BaseRecord
  attributes :id, :first_name, :last_name, :phone, :email, :source, # etc.
end
```

Now you can issue requests more easily with your record class, e.g.:

```ruby
# Request a (paginated) list of all Lead records
Lead.all

# Get the Lead instance with a specific ID
Lead.find('78265000003433063')
```

And even create new Lead entries in Zoho:

```ruby
lead = Lead.new(
  first_name: 'First name',
  last_name: 'Last name',
  phone: '+35197736281',
  email: 'myemail@gmail.com',
  source: 'Homepage'
)

# Creates the new lead
lead.save

# Or in one step:
lead = Lead.create(first_name: 'First name', ...)
```

Updating records:

```ruby
Lead.update(id: lead.id, first_name: "...", last_name: "...")

# Or
lead.update(first_name: "...", last_name: "...")

# Or update up to 100 records in one call:
leads = [{ id: id1, phone: "123" }, { id: id2, first_name: "..." }]
Lead.update_all(leads)
```

Blueprint transition:

```ruby
Lead.blueprint_transition(lead.id, transition_id)

# Or
lead.blueprint_transition(transition_id)
```

Adding notes:

```ruby
Lead.add_note(id: lead.id, title: 'Note title', content: 'Note content')
```

Related records:

```ruby
Product.all_related(parent_module: 'Lead', parent_id: lead.id)
Product.add_related(
  parent_module: 'Lead',
  parent_id: lead.id,
  related_id: product.id
)
Product.remove_related(
  parent_module: 'Lead',
  parent_id: lead.id,
  related_id: product.id
)
Product.update_related(...)
```

Attachments (`ZohoHub::Attachment` is defined in the gem):

```ruby
Lead.related_attachments(parent_id: lead.id)
# -> Array of Attachments

attachment = Lead.download_attachment(parent_id: lead.id, attachment_id:attachment.id)
# -> Attachment (attachment.file contains the file as a Tempfile)

#NB: Lead.upload_attachment not implemented yet
```

## 8 Notifications

Zoho allows you to receive a notification when a record of a module changes. Supported operation types are create, delete, edit, all.

### 8.1 Enable notifications

In order to receive notifications, you have to enable them first.

```ruby
# Enable notifications for a given channel:
notification_url = 'https://example.org/api/notifications' # Zoho will send notifications by POST to this url
token = '123abc' # Zoho will send this token back to you, so you can ensure that the notification is from Zoho
channel_id = 1 # Choose a channel to handle the response
events = %w[Leads.create Deals.edit Contacts.delete Sales_Orders.all] # Which events to receive notifications for
channel_expiry = (DateTime.now + 1.day).iso8601 # choose a date when the channel should expire. 24h is the maximum, default is one hour

ZohoHub::Notifications.enable(notification_url, channel_id, events, channel_expiry, token)
```

After enabling notifications, Zoho will execute a POST request to the provided notification_url every time the requested event occurs.

For a list of an in-depth description of the response, check the [Zoho documentation](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/notifications/overview.html)

### 8.2 List notifications

You can also retrieve all notifications that are currently enabled and that you are receiving uppdates for.

```ruby
# Get all enabled notifications
ZohoHub::Notifications.all
```

### 8.3 Caveats

- Zoho does not notify you when records are merged.
- Since Zoho does not tell you what changed, you will have to request the record by yourself. Due to this you can miss changes, when they occur quickly after another. This is especially important for status changes, as you might miss state changes.

## Tips and suggestions

- Using a tool such as Postman or curl to issue HTTP requests and verify responses in isolation
  can be a great sanity check during setup.
- Downloading ZohoHub code (as opposed to the gem) and running `bin/console` is a great way to
  learn how the code works and test aspects of setup and Zoho's API in isolation.
- [The Zoho API Documentation](https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/developer/api/overview.html) is your
  friend - especially the sample HTTP requests and responses in the various sections under "Rest
  API" on the left.
- If you're manually implementing your record classes (rather than using the reflection mechanism),
  the files in `/examples/models/` can help you get started.
- Requests can be issued to Zoho CRM's
  [Sandbox](https://help.zoho.com/portal/kb/articles/using-sandbox)
  by configuring `https://crmsandbox.zoho.com/crm` (or regional equivalent) as the `api_domain`.

## Examples

### Setup auth token and request CurrentUser

> This example assumes use of the dotenv gem and is written directly into
> ZohoHub's root directory (rather than using ZohoHub as a gem) for simplicity.

1. Edit `bin/console` to comment out refreshing the token and setting up the connection:

```ruby
# bin/console

...
# puts 'Refreshing token...'
# token_params = ZohoHub::Auth.refresh_token(ENV['ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN'])
# ZohoHub.setup_connection(token_params)
...
```

2. [Register your application](#1-register-your-application) to obtain a **client ID** and
   **secret**. (Leave the [Zoho API Credentials page](https://accounts.zoho.com/developerconsole) open;
   you'll need it in step 5.)
3. Determine your [Zoho Accounts URL](#11-zoho-accounts-url).
4. Add your registration and account URL information to a `.env` file:

```
# .env

ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
ZOHO_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
ZOHO_API_DOMAIN=YOUR_ZOHO_ACCOUNTS_URL
```

5. On the [Zoho API Credentials page](https://accounts.zoho.com/developerconsole) from step 1, click
   the three vertical dots and select `Self client`.
6. Paste this into the `Scope` field: `ZohoCRM.users.ALL`, choose an expiration time, and click
   `View Code`; this is your **Grant token**.
7. Run the ZohoHub console from your terminal: `bin/console`
8. Issue a token request with the **grant token** (notice the quotes around the token value):

```ruby
ZohoHub::Auth.get_token('paste_your_grant_token_here')
```

This should return a response with an **access token**, e.g.:

```ruby
=> {:access_token=>"ACCESS_TOKEN_VALUE",
 :expires_in_sec=>3600,
 :api_domain=>"https://www.zohoapis.com",
 :token_type=>"Bearer"
 }
```

exit the console with `exit`.

9. Add the access token to your `.env` file:

```
# .env

ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
ZOHO_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
ZOHO_API_DOMAIN=YOUR_ZOHO_ACCOUNTS_URL
ZOHO_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

10. Edit `bin/console` to add a new `setup_connection` after the previously commented out one:

```ruby
# bin/console

...
# ZohoHub.setup_connection(token_params)

ZohoHub.setup_connection(access_token: ENV['ZOHO_ACCESS_TOKEN'])
...
```

11. Start the console again: `bin/console`.

12. Issue a request for the current user: `ZohoHub.connection.get 'users?type=CurrentUser'`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run
the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
